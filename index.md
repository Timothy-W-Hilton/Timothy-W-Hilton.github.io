This placeholder was meant to redirect to
my [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/Timothy-W-Hilton), but it
didn't work.

I'm a project scientist
in [Elliott Campbell's lab](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/ecampbell3/)
at the [University of California Merced](http://www.ucmerced.edu).
Our work seeks to improve predictions of future climate by reducing
the uncertainty in the amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide removed
from the atmosphere by the terrestrial biosphere.

I've developed several open source research codes to help in our work,
and they are hosted on
my [github page](https://github.com/Timothy-W-Hilton/)

I'm also
on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timothy_Hilton)
