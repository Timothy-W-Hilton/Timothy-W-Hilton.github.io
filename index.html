I'm a project scientist in Elliott Campbell's lab at the University of
California Merced.  Our work seeks to improve predictions of future
climate by reducing the uncertainty in the amount of anthropogenic
carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by the terrestrial
biosphere.

I've developed several open source research codes to help in our work,
and they are hosted on my github page:
